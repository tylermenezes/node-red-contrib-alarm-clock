# Alarm Clock

These nodes let you create alarm clocks, **set their alarm time in a flow,** and then trigger automations when they
alarm (plus or minus an offset).

This is unlike most other nodes in that the alarm time is set by sending a flow payload, rather than in the NodeRED
editor, which allows you to adjust alarm times based on user interactions or complex conditions.
